                <p>Sigiriya is an ancient rock fortress located in the central Matale District in Sri Lanka. It is one of the country's most popular tourist destinations and a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>
                <p>The history of Sigiriya dates back to the 5th century when it was used as a rock shelter monastery by Buddhist monks. In the 3rd century BC, it was turned into a royal residence by King Kashyapa, who is credited with the construction of the fortress and the famous Sigiriya frescoes.</p>
                <p>King Kashyapa was the son of King Dhatusena, but he was not the rightful heir to the throne. He killed his father and seized power, fearing that his half-brother Moggallana, who was the rightful heir, would seek revenge.</p>
                <p>Kashyapa moved his capital to Sigiriya and began a massive construction project, building a palace complex on top of the 200-meter-high rock. The palace was surrounded by gardens, ponds, and fountains, and it was decorated with frescoes and sculptures. The most famous of these frescoes are the "Sigiriya Maidens," which depict beautiful women with intricate hairstyles and jewelry.</p>
                <p>However, Kashyapa's reign was short-lived. In 495 AD, Moggallana invaded Sigiriya with an army and defeated Kashyapa in a battle. Kashyapa committed suicide, and Moggallana took the throne.</p>
                <p>After Moggallana's victory, Sigiriya was used as a Buddhist monastery again, and it continued to be used for this purpose until the 14th century. It was rediscovered by British archaeologists in the 19th century, and since then, it has become one of Sri Lanka's most popular tourist destinations.</p>

                <p>4: The Mirror Wall: The Mirror Wall is a polished wall located at the base of the rock fortress. It was originally coated with a reflective material and is believed to have been used as a surface for painting or as a mirror.</p>
                <p>5: The Lion's Paw: At the top of the rock fortress, there is a platform that is shaped like a lion's paw. The platform was once home to a massive lion statue that guarded the entrance to the palace, but today only the paws remain.</p>

                <p>The Sigiriya Frescoes are a series of ancient paintings located on a sheltered rock face about 100 meters above ground level at Sigiriya, Sri Lanka. They are considered to be one of the most important and well-preserved ancient frescoes in the world.</p>
                <p>The frescoes at Sigiriya are believed to have been created during the reign of King Kashyapa, who ruled Sri Lanka in the 5th century AD. The paintings depict more than 500 figures, including 21 female figures known as the "Sigiriya Maidens." The maidens are depicted with intricate hairstyles, jewelry, and colorful dresses, and they are believed to be either celestial nymphs or members of Kashyapa's court.</p>
                <p>The paintings are executed in a style that is unique to Sigiriya, with a mix of Indian and Sri Lankan influences. They are painted on a smooth plaster surface using natural pigments made from minerals and plant materials. The colors used in the frescoes include black, white, red, yellow, and green.</p> 
                <p>Over the centuries, the frescoes have suffered some damage due to natural erosion and human interference. In the 20th century, efforts were made to preserve and protect the frescoes, including the construction of a shelter to protect them from the elements.</p>
                <p>Today, visitors to Sigiriya can view the frescoes as part of a guided tour of the site. While it is not possible to get up close to the paintings, visitors can still appreciate their beauty and importance as a window into the art and culture of ancient Sri Lanka.</p>
