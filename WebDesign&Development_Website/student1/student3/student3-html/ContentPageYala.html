                <p>Yala National Park is a wildlife sanctuary and national park located in the southeastern region of Sri Lanka. It is one of the country's most popular national parks, known for its diverse range of wildlife and scenic landscapes. The park covers an area of 979 square kilometers and is home to a variety of animals, including elephants, leopards, sloth bears, crocodiles, and many species of birds.</p>
                <p>Yala National Park is divided into five blocks, two of which are open to the public: Block 1 and Block 5. Block 1 is the most popular and is known for its high concentration of leopards, while Block 5 is less visited but offers excellent bird watching opportunities.</p>
                <p>The park also features several important archaeological sites, including the Sithulpawwa Rock Temple, which dates back to the 2nd century BC. Visitors can explore these ancient ruins and learn about the region's rich cultural history.</p>
                <p>Yala National Park is open year-round, although the best time to visit is from February to July when the park's water levels are at their lowest, and animals congregate around the remaining watering holes. The park can be visited independently or as part of a guided tour, with a range of accommodations available both within and outside the park.</p>

                <p>Yala National Park has a long and fascinating history. It was originally used as a hunting ground by the British colonial rulers in the late 19th century, and was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1900. In 1938, it was designated a national park, becoming the second national park in Sri Lanka after Wilpattu.</p>
                <p>During the Sri Lankan Civil War, which lasted from 1983 to 2009, the park was closed to the public for safety reasons. However, after the war ended, the park was reopened, and has since become a popular destination for both local and international visitors.</p>
                <p>In recent years, Yala National Park has faced several challenges, including habitat loss due to human encroachment, poaching, and conflicts between humans and wildlife. However, conservation efforts have been undertaken to protect the park's biodiversity and ensure its long-term sustainability.</p>
